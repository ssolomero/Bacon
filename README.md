iOS 13 & Swift 5 --
Single home page of a Peer-to-Peer payment application. Only UI, no functionality. 

# Purpose
Familiarize myself with SwiftUI. In my previous position, I was a Product Designer, and I designed a complete P2P payment application. I wanted to see how feasible it was to develop my designs.
